# WritingTypeRecognition-CNN

I was having problems such as overfitting in my previous libraryless deep learning model. My goal in that model was to understand the working logic of deep learning. Now I applied CNN to my "Writing Type Recognition" work. I got better results. You can examine the architecture of my model in following image and  my codes and detailed explanation of the model at noteebook.
